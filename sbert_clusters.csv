we examined a multiarmed bandit with a limited number of arms where each arm operates as a homogeneous markov process on a finite state space one of the arms known as the odd arm has a transition law that is different from the common transition law of the other arms a learner lacking knowledge of these transition laws must create a sequential test to quickly identify the odd arm without exceeding a certain probability of error we have established a minimum expected stopping time for any sequential test as the probability of error approaches zero additionally we have proposed a sequential test whose expected stopping time closely approaches this minimum while previous research has focused on independent and identically distributed arms our work specifically addresses markov arms this analysis of the markov setting is an essential initial step in understanding the more complex case of restless markov settings which remains unexplored,17

systems that track multiple targets across multiple cameras mtmct monitor targets across different cameras tracking systems typically restrict their data association to a local area because of the continuity of target trajectories the term local neighborhood refers to consecutive frames in singlecamera tracking and neighboring cameras that the target may appear in successively in multicamera tracking tracking systems frequently use appearance features learned from the reidentification reid viewpoint to estimate similarity unlike tracking reid does not usually have access to the trajectory cues that can restrict the search space to a local area because of its global matching characteristics the reid viewpoint requires learning global appearance features we contend that the disparity between the local matching process in tracking and the global nature of reid appearance features may impair mtmct performance in this study we propose the localityaware appearance metric laam to address this issue specifically we create an intracamera metric for singlecamera tracking and an intercamera metric for multicamera tracking these metrics are trained using local neighborhood data pairs rather than global sampling used in the reid,10

process mining techniques aim to extract insights from event logs about how things are done when applied to data from smart home environments process mining has the potential to provide valuable insights into both healthy and unhealthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions however the events recorded in smart home environments are on the level of sensor triggers which causes process discovery algorithms to produce overly general process models that allow for too much behavior and are difficult for human experts to interpret we demonstrate that raising the level of event interpretation can enable the discovery of more precise and more comprehensible models we present a framework for feature extraction that can be used for abstraction with supervised learning methods and is based on the xes ieee standard for event logs this framework can automatically abstract sensorlevel events to their interpretation at the human activity level after being trained on training data that includes both the sensor and human activity events our abstraction framework is demonstrated on three reallife smart home event logs and the results show that the process models that can be discovered after abstraction are indeed more precise,13

the countmin sketch is an important and wellstudied data summarization method it allows one to estimate the count of any item in a stream using a small fixed size data sketch however the accuracy of the sketch depends on characteristics of the underlying data this has led to a number of count estimation procedures which work well in one scenario but perform poorly in others a practitioner is faced with two basic unanswered questions which variant should be chosen when the data is unknown given an estimate is its error sufficiently small to be trustworthy we provide answers to these questions we derive new count estimators including a provably optimal estimator which best or match previous estimators in all scenarios we also provide practical tight error bounds at query time for both new and existing estimators these error estimates also yield procedures to choose the sketch tuning parameters optimally as they can extrapolate the error to different choices of sketch width and depth the key observation is that the distribution of errors in each counter can be empirically estimated from the sketch itself by first estimating this distribution count estimation becomes a statistical estimation and inference problem with a known error distribution this provides both a principled way to derive new and optimal estimators as well as a way to study the error and properties of existing estimators,16

text the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation and its relationship to student and teacher architectures we begin by noting that more accurate teachers do not always make effective teachers and we try to identify the factors that affect knowledge distillation performance we find that larger models do not necessarily make better teachers and this is due to a mismatch in capacity where small students are unable to mimic large teachers we demonstrate that common methods of addressing this issue such as performing a sequence of knowledge distillation steps are ineffective finally we show that this effect can be mitigated by stopping the teachers training early our findings apply to a wide range of datasets and models,5

the countmin sketch is a wellresearched method for summarizing data it allows for estimating the count of any item in a stream using a small fixedsize data sketch however the accuracy of the sketch depends on the characteristics of the underlying data leading to different count estimation procedures that perform well in some scenarios but poorly in others this presents practitioners with two fundamental unanswered questions which variant should be chosen when the data is unknown and is the error of a given estimate sufficiently small to be reliable our research addresses these questions by introducing new count estimators including an optimal estimator that either outperforms or matches previous estimators in all scenarios we also provide tight error bounds at query time for both new and existing estimators these error estimates also help in choosing the optimal tuning parameters for the sketch as they can predict the error for different choices of sketch width and depth the key insight is that the error distribution in each counter can be empirically estimated from the sketch itself by estimating this distribution count estimation becomes a statistical estimation and inference problem with a known error distribution providing a principled way to derive new and optimal estimators as well as to study the error and properties of existing estimators,16

mtmct systems are used to track targets across multiple cameras and they typically limit their data association to a local neighborhood in order to ensure the continuity of target trajectories in single camera tracking the local neighborhood refers to consecutive frames while in multicamera tracking it refers to neighboring cameras where the target may appear in succession these tracking systems often use appearance features learned from a reidentification reid perspective for similarity estimation unlike tracking reid does not have access to trajectory cues and requires learning global appearance features for matching the discrepancy between the local matching process in tracking and the global nature of reid appearance features may impact the performance of mtmct to address this we propose the use of a locality aware appearance metric laam to fit the local matching process in mtmct this includes designing an intracamera metric for single camera tracking and an intercamera metric for multicamera tracking both trained with data pairs sampled from their corresponding local neighborhoods we demonstrate that these locally learned metrics can effectively complement globally learned reid features with this approach we have achieved stateoftheart performance on the dukemtmc dataset and a significant improvement on the cityflow dataset,10

a bitquantum map relates probabilistic information for ising spins or classical bits to quantum spins or qubits quantum systems are subsystems of classical statistical systems the ising spins can represent macroscopic twolevel observables and the quantum subsystem employs suitable expectation values and correlations we discuss static memory materials based on ising spins for which boundary information can be transported through the bulk in a generalized equilibrium state they can realize quantum operations as the hadamard or cnotgate for the quantum subsystem classical probabilistic systems can account for the entanglement of quantum spins an arbitrary unitary evolution for an arbitrary number of quantum spins can be described by static memory materials for an infinite number of ising spins which may in turn correspond to continuous variables or fields we discuss discrete subsets of unitary operations realized by a finite number of ising spins they may be useful for new computational structures we suggest that features of quantum computation or more general probabilistic computation may be realized by neural networks neuromorphic computing or perhaps even the brain this does neither require small isolated entities nor very low temperature in these systems the processing of probabilistic information can be more general than for static memory materials we propose a general formalism for probabilistic computing for which deterministic computing and quantum computing are special limiting cases,16

this paper delves into the intricate structure of the dotdepth hierarchy as initially formulated by brzozowski and cohen which provides a method for classifying starfree languages based on their syntactic complexity through a series of detailed analyses we examine the properties and limitations of the dotdepth hierarchy exploring its significance in the realm of formal language theory we outline the sequential levels of the hierarchy each characterized by the inclusion of concatenation and boolean operations to a certain extent thus revealing how the complexity of starfree languages increases with each successive level furthermore by employing advanced combinatorial and algebraic techniques we demonstrate how the hierarchy relates to the recognizability by finite monoids and the quantifier alternation hierarchy in logic our research clarifies the hierarchys role in delineating the boundaries between regular languages that are starfree and those that are not we also present new findings that extend the current understanding of the hierarchy including the identification of languages at specific dotdepth levels,15

architectural design experience is captured by architecture patterns which offer general solutions to frequently encountered architectural design issues they specify the types of components and constrain how they can be connected and activated ensuring that the resulting architectures have certain desirable characteristics unfortunately most documented patterns do not offer a formal guarantee that their specifications will result in the promised guarantees this could result in inappropriate architecturesâie architectures mistakenly believed to exhibit certain desirable traits since architectures have a significant impact on a systems quality and fixing architectural flaws is challenging if not impossible this could result in severe and irreparable quality issues in the final product to address this issue we suggest a modelcheckingbased technique to confirm that pattern specifications match their guarantees we use the technique on three wellknown dynamic architecture patternsâthe singleton the modelviewcontroller and the broker patternâand discover ambiguities and missing constraints in all three specifications as a result we conclude that using model checking to validate dynamic architecture patterns is both practical and beneficial for discovering flaws and ambiguities in pattern specific,12
